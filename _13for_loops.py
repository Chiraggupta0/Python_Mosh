for number in range(3):
    print("sending a message", number+1,(number+1)*".")
#  in for loop number is an integer like in java we write i=0;i<n;i++ here that i is number range(3) defines the no of times this loop will run

#  if want to start loop from 1 and end till 10 and want to skip 2 each time then we can code like this
for number in range(1,10,2):
    print("sending a message", number,(number)*".")
